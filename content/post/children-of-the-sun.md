Fighting and burning from turning from who we really are
对抗真我而被引燃 紧接回身躲避
Cannot suppress so let's find the one we have shaped so far
再难压抑 追寻吾至今塑造之唯一
Flying too close to the sun as if we're invincible
极尽距离逐日而去 仿佛无可匹敌
Cannot dictate, dominate the earth that we're living on
不能左右栖息之地 统治徒劳无力
We can't defy the laws, cut the laws that we consummate
不可蔑视 不可背弃手中圆满法律
Around the world we grow weaker as we exterminate
远观世界 吾辈日益脆弱深陷绝地
The only thing that gives thing that brings air and life to us
无二独一 创造神物赐我天空生命
Wake up one day and find what we got is serious
它将苏醒 发觉人类所得已是荆棘

We are the children of the sun
我们 是太阳之后人

We are the children of the sun
我们 是太阳的子孙

The human creed and our creators well that we have to share
造物主与世间信条 总由天下共守
Weep deep in tragical fabrical issues everywhere
沦入满地悲惨琐碎 深藏泪水横流
Cannot replace the one, chase the one that we used to be
无法取代无法企及 无法重现往昔
It isn't how we were, what we were, what we meant to be
不问起因不问本质 不问何为意义

Fighting and burning from turning from who we really are
对抗真我而被引燃 紧接回身躲避
Cannot suppress so let's find the one we have shaped so far
再难压抑 追寻吾至今塑造之唯一
Flying too close to the sun as if we're invincible
极尽距离逐日而去 仿佛无可匹敌
Cannot dictate our faith on the earth that we're living on
不能左右心中信仰 脚下仍是土地

We are the children of the sun
我们 是太阳之后人
The love for everyone
爱会沐泽众生
Always on the run
一刻不停息
The fire in our eyes
烈焰在我眼中
The passion never dies
盛情永不暗淡
We're the chosen ones
我们被选中
The children of the sun
为太阳的子孙

We are the children of the sun
我们 是太阳之后人
The love for everyone
爱会沐泽众生
Always on the run
一刻不停息
The fire in our eyes
烈焰在我眼中
The passion never dies
盛情永不暗淡
We're the chosen ones
我们被选中
The children of the sun
为太阳的子孙

We are, we are we are the children of the sun
太阳，太阳，我们是太阳的后人
We are, we are the children of the sun
太阳，我们是太阳的子孙
We are, we are, we are the children(of the sun)
太阳，太阳，我们是太阳的后人
Always on the run
永远向前进
```
